# CLAUDE.md

Firmware for the Wurkkos TS26 torch (Anduril model 0721) (ATtiny1616, MP3432 boost driver), in Rust, with zero crate dependencies. It's a deliberately small sibling of wurkkos-ts21 and borrows its toolchain and much of its code. Read README.md for what it is, CONTRIBUTING.md for the checks and layout, and docs/ for the hardware, toolchain and UI spec.

## Commands

```sh
cargo fmt --check                                          # formatting, as CI runs it
cargo test --workspace --locked -q                         # host tests, run these constantly
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings   # host lints
cargo clippy --package ts26 --release --target avr-none -Zbuild-std=core -- -D warnings   # firmware lints: the only place hw.rs and rt.rs get linted
cargo xtask hex                                            # firmware ELF and hex, plus flash/RAM use, after any firmware change
```

CONTRIBUTING.md lists every check CI runs. Plain `cargo test` only tests the root package, so always pass `--workspace`.

The firmware clippy and the xtask commands rebuild `core` with `-Zbuild-std`. The first run on a machine fetches crates from crates.io and writes to `~/.cargo` and `~/.rustup`, which the sandbox may block. If it does, rerun outside the sandbox; nothing else in this repo needs that.

## Agents

Agents in `.claude/agents/` report back and never edit. Use them rather than doing the same work inline:

- `register-checker`: after touching `src/regs.rs`, `src/hw.rs` or `src/rt.rs`.
- `avr-codegen`: when `cargo xtask hex` fails to link, or flash or RAM grows and you want to know why.
- `hardware-researcher`: before writing a new fact into docs/hardware.md.
- `microchip-docs`: when you need what the datasheet, errata or an app note says. It searches the local PDFs in `docs/microchip/`, which are gitignored and only exist in the main checkout.

## Working in this repo

- **Edit `.rs` files with Edit or Write**, not `sed -i`, `cp` or a heredoc. The lint hook only runs on Edit and Write.
- **Parallel agents get their own worktree and their own files.** Never `git stash` to compare before and after; use a WIP commit or a second worktree.
- **The sandbox can't write `.git/config`**, so `git push -u` pushes but can't record the upstream. Push with `git push origin <branch>`, pass `--head <branch>` to `gh pr create`, and don't try to fix the tracking.
- **PRs merge by rebase only**, so every commit on a branch lands on main as written. Keep each one single-line and passing.

## Rules that bite

- **No dependencies.** Not in the firmware, not in xtask. If something seems to need a crate, write the small part you need, or ask first.
- **Never write fuses, and never suggest a command that does.** A wrong `SYSCFG0` disables UPDI, and only a high-voltage programmer gets it back. `cargo xtask flash` writes flash only.
- **Never run `cargo xtask ping`, `backup`, `flash` or `restore` yourself.** They drive real hardware on a serial port, and `.claude/settings.json` denies them. Give the user the command. Test UPDI changes against the fake chip in `xtask/src/updi.rs`, and add a case there for any new sequence.
- **The UPDI programmer never writes fuses, the user row or a locked chip.** Don't add any of that without the user asking for it explicitly.
- **Every register address and bit mask lives in `src/regs.rs` and comes from the ATDF** (`vendor/ATtiny1616.atdf`), with a comment naming the register. No bare register numbers in `src/hw.rs` or `src/rt.rs`. Add a check for each new constant to `xtask/src/atdf.rs`; an unchecked one is dead code there and fails clippy. Use the `register-checker` agent after touching `src/regs.rs`, `src/hw.rs` or `src/rt.rs`, for what the ATDF can't express.
- **16-bit peripheral registers: low byte first.** Use `write16` in `src/hw.rs`.
- **The boost converter's enable (PB2) is the dangerous pin.** It's low whenever the light's off, including at reset and in the panic handler. Turn on by setting the duty and then raising the enable; turn off by dropping the enable and then zeroing the duty. Never give PB2 a pull-up.
- **PA1 is analogue (the battery divider) and PA0 is UPDI.** `hw::init` leaves both pins' settings alone. Don't add a pull-up to either.
- **Logic goes in the library** (`src/lib.rs` and its modules), which is `no_std`, has no `unsafe`, and is tested on the host. `src/main.rs` stays a thin loop.
- **docs/ui.md is the UI spec.** Change it in the same commit as the code, and add a test in `src/ui.rs` or `src/torch.rs` for every row you add.
- **Tick off docs/roadmap.md** in the commit that does the work.
- **Anduril is GPL-3.0.** Read it for facts about the hardware (pins, calibration, timings) and cite the file. Don't copy its code or its ramp tables into this MIT repo.
- **No runtime 32- or 64-bit multiplication.** The chip has an 8×8 hardware multiplier, so 8- and 16-bit multiplies compile to `mul` instructions, but there's no libgcc, so anything wider fails to link with `undefined symbol: __mulsi3`. That includes dividing a `u16` by a constant that isn't a power of two (`x / 10`, `x % 10`), which LLVM turns into a 32-bit multiply. Host tests won't catch it; `cargo xtask hex` will. 8-bit maths, 16-bit multiplies, division by a runtime value, and `const fn` maths are fine. docs/toolchain.md has the options.
- **Flash is 16 KB and RAM is 2 KB.** Check `cargo xtask hex` after changes. No `core::fmt` in the firmware (it pulls in kilobytes), and no floats.
- **Mark uncertainty.** docs/hardware.md labels facts as confirmed or likely. Keep doing that; don't promote a guess to a fact.
- **No simulator.** Unlike the TS21, nothing runs the firmware before it reaches a torch. A firmware change that the host tests can't see needs reading against the datasheet (the `register-checker` agent) before anyone flashes it.

## Things that look wrong but aren't

- `.rodata` is linked at 0x808000 and up: AVR ELF files put data space at 0x800000, plus the mapped-flash window at 0x8000. It's how const tables are read without `lpm`.
- `src/main.rs` has a host `fn main()` that exits with an error. It's there so the workspace builds and tests on the host.
- `hw::wait_for_tick` busy-waits. Sleep is roadmap stage 2.
