//! Not firmware: a program with one static of each kind, for `cargo xtask`
//! to check link.x and src/rt.rs against. The torch firmware has no statics
//! yet, so as linked its .rodata, .data and .bss are all empty and nothing
//! real reads through the mapped-flash window or relies on the startup copy.
//!
//! `main` copies a const table (.rodata, read through the mapped-flash
//! window) and a static with non-zero starting values (.data, which the
//! startup code copies from flash) into a static that starts at zero (.bss),
//! then stops in `link_probe_done`. xtask checks where the linker put each
//! section (`layout::memory`) and that none of them came out empty
//! (`probe_sections` in xtask/src/main.rs), then runs it on the simulator from
//! reset, with SRAM full of junk, and reads back what it copied (`sim::probe`).
//! `cargo xtask hex` builds this alongside the firmware; it's never flashed.
