//! Thermal regulation: temperature readings in, a ceiling on the level out.
//!
//! Feed it a reading from `temp::sixteenths` every [`CYCLE_TICKS`] ticks with
//! [`Thermal::sample`], call [`Thermal::tick`] every tick, and run the light
//! at whichever is lower, the UI's level or the ceiling. The ceiling moves
//! through a [`Gradual`], so a step-down is a fade of at most one level every
//! other tick, never a jump.
//!
//! The approach follows the one Anduril describes in `fsm/adc.c` and
//! `ui/anduril/ramp-mode.c` (facts only, it's GPL-3.0):
//!
//! - Smooth the readings, then predict where the temperature is heading from
//!   how far it's moved over the last eight samples, times a lookahead of
//!   four. Anduril uses the same history length and lookahead.
//! - If the prediction is over the limit and it isn't already cooling, step
//!   down. The error adds up over readings and each step spends some of it,
//!   so a little over steps down now and then and a lot over steps down
//!   every reading. Anduril's warning threshold works much the same way.
//! - If the prediction is more than 2 °C under the limit (Anduril's window)
//!   and it isn't warming up, step back up the same way, but slower and never
//!   more than a level a reading. In between, hold. That gap, the slow climb
//!   and the lookahead are what stop it hunting.
//! - Never step down below a floor. Anduril's TS26 build stops at level 50 of
//!   150 (`MIN_THERM_STEPDOWN` in `hw/wurkkos/ts26/anduril.h`), so this does
//!   too, though the same number on our own curve (`src/ramp.rs`) needn't be
//!   the same brightness.
//!
//! Only sample while the light's on. Anduril leaves the temperature alone
//! in standby because the ADC costs about 250 µA against about 20 µA asleep
//! (`fsm/adc.c`), and the torch will sleep when off. Call [`Thermal::reset`]
//! when it turns on, so the readings and ceiling from last time don't carry
//! over. A light that turns on hot then steps down from the first readings.
//! - Ignore a reading that's impossible or far from the last one, unless a
//!   few in a row agree. If the sensor keeps reading impossible values, step
//!   down to the floor, since a broken sensor can't say it's cool.
//!
//! The numbers here are a first guess, carried over from the TS21 where
//! they aren't Anduril's. None of them has been measured on a TS26, so expect
//! them to change once one's been run up to temperature. That's why
//! `ramp::CEILING` holds the light back in the meantime.
