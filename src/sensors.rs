//! Sharing the one ADC between the cell's voltage and the temperature
//! sensor.
//!
//! The ADC alternates every 8 ticks, so each gets a reading every 16 ticks
//! (four a second, what `battery::Protection` and `thermal::Thermal` expect),
//! the temperature 8 ticks after the voltage. Each turn takes three ticks.
//!
//! ```text
//! tick 0   set the ADC up for the voltage, start a conversion
//! tick 1   throw that result away, start another
//! tick 2   that result is the voltage
//! tick 8   set it up for the temperature, start a conversion
//! tick 9   throw that result away, start another
//! tick 10  that result is the temperature
//! ```
//!
//! The ADC's only set up when the channel changes. While a click's being
//! counted with the light off it reads nothing but the voltage, so after the
//! first round it skips the setup and goes straight to converting.
//!
//! A conversion takes a fraction of a millisecond, so it's always done by
//! the next tick, and nothing ever waits on the ADC.
//!
//! The datasheet doesn't ask for the first conversion after a switch to be
//! thrown away. It does say the ADC needs time to settle on a new channel,
//! and the internal reference about 25 µs to start (DS40002204A, sections
//! 30.3.2.4 and 36.15). Both channels here use the same 1.1 V reference, so
//! only the ADC's input moves between them, but PA1 sits behind tens of
//! kilohms of divider (docs/hardware.md), which is slow to pull the sample
//! capacitor away from whatever the temperature sensor left on it. The stock
//! firmware throws the first one away too ("first result is unstable").
//! It costs a tick, so it's cheap insurance.
//!
//! The temperature is only read when asked for, which the caller does while
//! the light's on. The voltage is read until [`Schedule::rest`], since the
//! ADC can't run in power-down, and starts again from the top after it.
