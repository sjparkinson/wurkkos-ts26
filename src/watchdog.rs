//! When to feed the watchdog.
//!
//! The firmware runs the WDT in window mode, as AN2632 §3.2 recommends. A
//! `wdr` in the closed window after the last one resets the chip, and so does
//! no `wdr` by the end of the open window that follows it. So a loop that's
//! stuck fails, and so does a jump into the wrong code that happens to land
//! on the feed.
//!
//! The WDT and the 64 Hz tick both run off the ultra-low-power oscillator, so
//! a tick is always 16 WDT clocks however far that oscillator drifts, and the
//! window can be sized in ticks. Feeding every tick would land on a window
//! edge whatever the setting, so the loop feeds every third tick. That's 48
//! clocks, halfway through a 32-clock open window that starts 32 clocks after
//! the last feed.
//!
//! Window mode only starts with the first `wdr` (DS40002204A §19.3.3.2). Until
//! then the WDT most likely times out after the open window alone (the
//! datasheet implies it rather than saying so), so the first pass feeds it
//! straight away, which also lines the windows up with the ticks.
//!
//! That's all there is. The TS21 also proves its watchdog at every power-on
//! with three deliberate resets and a marker in `.noinit`. This firmware
//! doesn't, by choice: that TS21 went dark straight after a verified flash of
//! that stack, and a firmware hang wasn't ruled out. So nobody's seen this
//! watchdog bite on a real chip until docs/bench-plan.md says so.
