# Microchip references

Microchip's datasheet, errata and app notes that matter for this firmware. It's the same chip as the TS21, so it's the same set of documents as [wurkkos-ts21](https://github.com/sjparkinson/wurkkos-ts21/tree/main/docs/microchip), with the notes changed for this light. The PDFs live in this directory on your machine but aren't in git: each one says "All Rights Reserved" and "No licenses are conveyed", so this public repo can't redistribute them. (The ATDF in `vendor/` is different; it's Apache-2.0.) `.gitignore` covers `*.pdf` here and a `txt/` cache of extracted text.

Each file is named `<document number><revision>-<short title>.pdf`, using the number printed on the document: the AN or TB number for app notes, the DS number for the rest. Microchip's download names are all over the place, so save each one under the name in the table, for example:

```sh
cd docs/microchip
curl -Lo AN2447A-measure-vcc-without-io-pin.pdf https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/AppNotes/00002447A.pdf
```

If you've got the TS21 repo checked out with its PDFs, copying them across is quicker. Either way, check you've got the same revisions:

```sh
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS
```

A newer revision will fail the check. That's fine if you want it, but rename the file to its new revision letter, update the table and `SHA256SUMS` in the same commit, and note what changed if it affects anything in `docs/hardware.md`.
