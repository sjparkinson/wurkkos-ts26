//! A UPDI programmer for the ATtiny1616, spoken over a serial adapter.
//!
//! UPDI is Microchip's one-wire debug and programming interface. A "serial
//! UPDI" programmer is a USB-serial chip with TX and RX joined onto that one
//! wire, so everything we send comes straight back as an echo before the
//! chip's reply. [`Wire`] hides the echo; this module only sees replies.
//!
//! The protocol is in the tinyAVR 1-series datasheet (DS40002204, the UPDI
//! chapter). The sequences here (link set-up, NVM key, reset, page writes)
//! follow Microchip's pymcuprog, the reference serial UPDI implementation.
//! Register addresses, the memory map and NVM commands come from the
//! ATtiny1616 ATDF in `vendor/`, through `ts26::regs`. The UPDI instruction
//! set isn't in the ATDF, so those stay hand-written.
//!
//! What this deliberately can't do: write fuses, write the user row, or
//! unlock a locked chip. None of those are needed to flash a TS26, and the
//! first can leave it unrecoverable without a high-voltage programmer.
